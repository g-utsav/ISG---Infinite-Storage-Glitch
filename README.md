# Infinite Storage Glitch (ISG) Implementation

The Infinite Storage Glitch (ISG) is a technique that encodes arbitrary files into video frames so they can be uploaded (e.g., to YouTube) as if they were video content. This Java implementation uses the JCodec library to encode and decode files into video frames.

## Features
- **Encoding**: Converts a file into a video by encoding its binary data into pixel blocks.
- **Decoding**: Extracts the original file from the encoded video.
- **Metadata Embedding**: Stores file metadata (e.g., file name, size) in the first frame of the video.
- **Robustness**: Uses block-based encoding to withstand video compression.

## üîß How It Works

ISG operates by converting file data into video frames, allowing the storage of non-video files on video-sharing platforms:

### Data Encoding: 
Files are encoded into video frames using either:
- **RGB Mode**: Each pixel encodes three bytes (one per color channel).
- **Binary Mode**: Each pixel represents a single bit, offering higher resilience against compression artifacts.

### Metadata Embedding: 
The first frame includes metadata (e.g., encoding mode, block size, original file size) to facilitate accurate decoding.

### Compression Resistance: 
To mitigate compression-induced data loss, the tool employs techniques like enlarging pixel blocks (e.g., 2x2) and adding redundancy.

## How Binary Encoding Works

- **Bit Representation**: Each bit of data is a solid square block of pixels. Black (RGB=0,0,0) represents 0, white (255,255,255) represents 1.
- **Block Size**: We use 2√ó2 pixels per bit by default. This redundancy makes the data robust: YouTube‚Äôs compression tends to preserve large uniform blocks even if individual pixels get slightly altered. (Empirically, 2√ó2 or 4√ó4 blocks are often used in ISG implementations for resilience.)
- **Frame Capacity**: If the video frame is W√óH pixels and block size is 2, each frame carries (W/2) * (H/2) bits. We fill one frame at a time with bits, row by row.
- **Metadata Frame**: The first frame is reserved for metadata about the encoded file. It is also drawn in black/white blocks. The metadata includes a magic string (e.g., "ISG1"), the file length, and the original filename. By convention we put these in the first frame so the decoder knows how to proceed.

### Example:
If we use 1280√ó720 frames (720p) and block=2, each frame can hold (1280/2)(720/2) = 320√ó360 = 115,200 bits = 14,400 bytes. A 100 KB file (‚âà102,400 bytes) would need one metadata frame + 8 data frames.

## Metadata Embedding

We define a simple metadata format. In the first frame, we write the following fields (in order), all as big-endian binary data:
1. **Magic String**: 4 ASCII bytes, e.g. "ISG1". This lets the decoder verify the format.
2. **File Size**: A 32-bit unsigned integer (4 bytes) giving the length of the original file in bytes.
3. **Filename Length**: A 32-bit integer (4 bytes) giving the length of the filename string.
4. **Filename**: UTF-8 bytes of the original file‚Äôs name (that many bytes).

Each of these is converted to bits (8 bits per byte) and written into the first frame‚Äôs pixel blocks from top-left onward. For example, the letters "I", "S", "G", "1" become 32 bits, followed by the 32-bit size, etc. 

(On decoding, we read the first frame block-by-block, reconstruct those bytes, and parse out the magic string, file length, and filename. If the magic is wrong or data is incomplete, we report an error. Once metadata is parsed, we know exactly how many data bits to read from the remaining frames (fileLength * 8 bits).)
